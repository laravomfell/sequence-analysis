# Comparing the Family Formation Trajectories of World War II Survivors

Using data from the SHARE survey, this analysis looks at the life and family formation trajectories of European citizens who have been directly affected by World War II (WWII). Its objective is the identication of how, compared to peers who did not experience war, the war lasting from 1939 to 1945 with 60{70 million fatalities and 11--20 million displaced affected family formation patterns. 

I look at men and women born in Austria, Germany, The Netherlands, Italy, France, Switzerland, Belgium, the Czech
Republic, and Poland before 1945. This paper uses a control-treatment approach where the WWII survivor group
is the "treatment" group and the "control" group consists
of individuals closely matching the characteristics of the treatment group without
having explicitly experienced war.

The original sample of WWII survivors consists of
1114 individuals born between 1910 and 1944 from those countries who experienced
war either through evacuation, as a prisoner of war, or as a concentration camp
survivor.

I find that most individuals, independently of whether they had first-hand experience of the war, fall into five trajectory groups: "Early Family Formation", "Later Family Formation", "Childless Marriage", "Childless Individuals" and "Non-traditional Parenthood". Compared to baseline France, individuals from Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and Switzerland are all significantly more likely to start their families later.
